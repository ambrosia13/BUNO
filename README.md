# BUNO

BUNO (Better UNO) is a simple command-line game that implements most standards of the popular UNO game, with a few extra features.

This is just a simple, just-for-fun game. In reality, players would play on different computers instead of all playing on the same computer.

## To run

1. Download the `.jar` file
2. In the command line, navigate to the directory in which you downloaded BUNO
3. Type `java -jar BUNO.jar`

## To build

1. Open the project in a sufficient IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA
2. In the command line, type `./gradlew fatJar` or `./gradlew jar`

# But wait! Singletons are bad design practice!

Yes. I used them anyway.
